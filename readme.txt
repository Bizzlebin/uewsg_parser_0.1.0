Description

The UEWSG Parser is a revolutionary parser that takes UEWSG-compliant text and converts it into other formats automatically. Since version 0.1.0 is part of a school project, it will only cover a small subset of the UEWSG's block constructs, it will only output to HTML, and it will not be versioned; check "Updated on" field to ensure a version match. A more "official" version may appear in the future; it will be announced at http://uewsg.org if and when it becomes available.
